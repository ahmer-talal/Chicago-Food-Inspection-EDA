# Chicago Food Inspections â€“ EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Chicago Food Inspections dataset to uncover compliance trends, violations, and risk patterns. The project applies systematic data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to generate insights relevant for public health and business compliance.

ðŸ”Ž Highlights

Cleaned and prepared raw inspection data (duplicates, missing values, outliers).

Analyzed inspection results, risk levels, and violation counts by facility type.

Visualized monthly trends and geographic distribution of inspections.

Extracted business-oriented insights to support compliance monitoring.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Notebook: Jupyter / Google Colab

ðŸ“Š Key Insights

High concentration of inspections fall under Risk 1 (High) â†’ critical compliance focus.

Certain facility types consistently record higher violations.

Geographic hotspots (specific ZIP codes) show higher inspection frequencies.

Monthly trends highlight seasonal variations in inspection counts.
